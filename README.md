 Author: Tronice Ray

 ## Business Problem
 How accurately can we find the Item Outlet Sales.
 

### This project shows the relation between low fat and regular fat items sales. Which sales better and if we see any connection as to why that is.
  
- Looking at sales of items based on fat content, we found low fat items sold more in comparison to regular fat items.

- Comparing the histogram chart to the multivariate countplot, you get a better understanding as to why low fat items sold more. There are three categories that are only low fat and there are no categories that are only regular fat.

## Summary of the model and its evaluation metrics
R^2 feature in the Regression Test Data shows a 53% chance of calculating the correct Item Outlet Sales. Showing we may need to go back and try other models to better find the correlation between the features and the target.
